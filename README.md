# Legacy Code Resurrection Project

This file is part of a glorious rescue mission: migrating ancient code from the dusty vaults of the internet to the shiny halls of GitHub.

This code has been preserved as faithfully as possible, warts and all. All code contained herein is original code written by Paul Nettle unless otherwise noted.

## Original description

VMath is a powerful NxM matrix template class which includes full support for matrices, vectors, points, homogenous transforms and more.

I use this in nearly every one of my 3D projects, and it's currently in use in a number of commercial games. It's proven, it's solid, it works.

## Why preserve this?

Because history matters. This code is a snapshot of how things were done back then—and in some cases, how they’re still done today. Think of it as open source time travel.

Happy coding!
